## How it works

A simple VGA 640x480 screen with fixed color shifting tiles.  

## How to test

rst_in(Active low Reset) input should be connected to a single pole single throw switch. rst_in should be pulled up to 3.3V using a 2K2 resistor. The other side of the switch should be connected to GND.
clk input must be 50Mhz; it is divided internally by 2 to supply 25 Mhz VGA pixel clock for 640x480 screen mode. 
8 bit bidirectional bus are configured as outputs. The connection from TT board to PmodVGA is as follows:
uo_out[7]-> R3, uo_out[6]-> R2, uo_out[5]-> R1, uo_out[4]->R0
uo_out[3]-> G3, uo_out[2]-> G2, uo_out[1]-> G1, uo_out[0]->G0
uio_out[7]->B3, uio_out[6]->B2, uio_out[5]->B1, uio_out[4]->B0
uio_out[3]->HS, uio_out[2]->VS
uio_out[1] and uio_out[0] output binary 0.
Enjoy the color screen.

## External hardware

Works with Digilent PmodVGA board with 12 color inputs (4R, 4G and 4B), horizontal and vertical signals.
